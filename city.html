<h1><u>KUALA LUMPUR</u></h1>
<p> <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>(Malaysian< pronunciation: <i>[ˈkualə, -a ˈlumpo(r), -ʊ(r)])</i> officially the <strong>Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</strong> (Malay: <strong>Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur</strong>) and colloquially referred to as <strong>KL</strong>, is a federal territory and the capital city of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. It is the largest city in <strong>Malaysia</strong>, covering an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) with an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016.[8] Greater <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, also known as the <strong>Klang Valley</strong>, is an urban agglomeration of 7.564 million people as of 2018.[4] It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in <i>Southeast Asia</i>, in both population and economic development.

<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is the cultural, financial and economic centre of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. It is also home to the <i>Parliament</i> of <strong>Malaysia</strong> and the official residence of the <i>Yang di-Pertuan Agong</i>, the <i>Istana Negara</i>. It first developed as a town serving the tin mines of the region circa 1857, before it became the capital of <strong>Selangor</strong> in 1880 until 1978, and the capital of <i>Malaya</i> before the formation of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government until these were relocated to <strong>Putrajaya</strong> in early 1999.[9] However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>.

<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is one of the three federal territories of <strong>Malaysia</strong>,[10] enclaved within the state of <strong>Selangor</strong>, on the central west coast of <i>Peninsular</i> <strong>Malaysia</strong>.[11] Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 <i>Commonwealth Games</i> and the 2017 <i>Southeast Asian Games</i>. <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the <i>Petronas Towers</i>, which have since become an iconic symbol of <strong>Malaysia</strong> in general.

<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, known as the <strong>Klang Valley</strong> <i>Integrated Transit System</i>. It was ranked as being the 6th most-visited city in the world in 2019 by <i>Mastercard</i>.[12] The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.[13] In 2020, <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> was named as the <i>World Book Capital</i> by <i>UNESCO</i>.[14][15]</p>

<h2><u>SETAPAK</u></h2>
<p> <strong>Setapak</strong> is a mukim in <strong>Gombak</strong> District, <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, <strong>Malaysia</strong>. Formerly a tin-mining and rubber-growing area, in <i>Malay</i> tapak means 'step' so <strong>Setapak</strong> means 'one step', probably referring to the close proximity of the suburb to <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>. Another explanation of the origin of its name traces to its historical roots</p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of <strong>Setapak</strong> were the aborigines (orang asli), and the <i>Minangkabaus</i>. [1]On 12 April 1884 <i>Frank Swettenham</i>, the <i>British Resident</i> of <strong>Selangor</strong> pleaded for the re-appointment of <i>Batu Tapak</i> as the headman of the aborigines living in that area, and hence the name <strong>Setapak</strong>, in honour of the headman.</p>

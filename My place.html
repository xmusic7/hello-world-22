<h1>Kuala Lumpur</h1>
<p>Kuala Lumpur(Malaysian pronunciation: <i>[ˈkualə, -a ˈlumpo(r), -ʊ(r)])</i> officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (Malay: Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur) and colloquially referred to as KL, is a federal territory and the capital city of Malaysia. It is the largest city in Malaysia, covering an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) with an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016.[8] Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.564 million people as of 2018.[4] It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.

Kuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Istana Negara. It first developed as a town serving the tin mines of the region circa 1857, before it became the capital of Selangor in 1880 until 1978, and the capital of Malaya before the formation of Malaysia. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government until these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999.[9] However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.

Kuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia,[10] enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.[11] Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysia in general.

Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, known as the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. It was ranked as being the 6th most-visited city in the world in 2019 by Mastercard.[12] The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.[13] In 2020, Kuala Lumpur was named as the World Book Capital by UNESCO.[14][15]</p>

<h2>Setapak</h2>
<p>Setapak is a mukim in Gombak District, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Formerly a tin-mining and rubber-growing area, in Malay tapak means 'step' so Setapak means 'one step', probably referring to the close proximity of the suburb to Kuala Lumpur. Another explanation of the origin of its name traces to its historical roots</p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of Setapak were the aborigines (orang asli), and the Minangkabaus. [1]On 12 April 1884 Frank Swettenham, the British Resident of Selangor pleaded for the re-appointment of Batu Tapak as the headman of the aborigines living in that area, and hence the name Setapak, in honour of the headman.</p>
